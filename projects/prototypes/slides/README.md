# Slides YSWS

**Created by:** Arnav

## 🌟 Elevator Pitch  
Slides YSWS is a cool project where you send us your Hack Club workshop slides, and in return, we ship you a pair of awesome sliders. It's a fun way to blend your digital creativity with a tangible, wearable reward.

## ⚙️ How It Works  
You design your Hack Club slides and submit them through our online form. Once we give them a quick look and approve them, we’ll ship out a pair of stylish sliders straight to your door. We keep things simple by using everyday tools for submission and reliable shipping partners to handle the delivery.

## 🎮 How It Plays (for Workshops)  
During the workshop, you'll get to create and submit your slides, and then enjoy the excitement of receiving a surprise pair of sliders. It’s an interactive experience that turns your digital work into something you can actually wear, sparking creativity and community spirit.

## 🚀 The Development Plan  
- **Team Collaboration:** I’m working with a small, dedicated team to manage slide submissions and handle shipping logistics.
- **Submission Process:** We’ll set up an easy-to-use online form where you can upload your Hack Club slides.
- **Review:** We’ll quickly review submissions to ensure they capture the creative vibe.
- **Shipping:** Once approved, we’ll partner with a trusted shipping service to deliver your sliders, maybe vistaprint.
