# deckd ꩜ .ᐟ
eight-week-long <ins><b>customized cyberdeck</b></ins> building project made with cheap, readily-available, off-the-shelf components, custom printed parts, and recycled/salvaged parts running linux mint.


## overview
### what is a cyberdeck?
a cyberdeck is a compact, diy computer inspired by cyberpunk aesthetics and hacker culture. it’s designed for portability, resilience, and customization—perfect for coding, hacking, and tinkering on the go.

### what is this project for?
this is a club-wide project submission where we'll be building a fully functional prototype for [hack club's multiverse leaders summit](multiverse.hackclub.com)

### what will they learn? 
they'll be learning about the following:
- hardware basics – choosing and assembling components (raspberry pi, display, keyboard, battery, etc.)
- 3d printing & customization – designing & printing casings, keycaps, and mounts
- linux essentials – installing, configuring, and personalizing linux mint for a cyberdeck setup
- command-line skills – navigating linux, setting up software, and scripting automation
- hacker culture & diy mindset – learning about open-source, security, and creative problem-solving

### do you have to have a lot of knowledge about hardware?
no, this project is beginner-friendly and is made for people of all levels of knowledge and experience. keep in mind though that the complexity level and timeline is based on the primary audience of middle school girls.

### who are you?
i'm [@anne on the hack club slack](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U07BBK4KHUK) and the club leader for a girls-in-tech hardware oriented club "code & cipher" from new delhi, india


## tech stack and components
**core:** raspberry pi
<br>
**os:** linux mint (lightweight, beginner-friendly)
<br>
**display:** small lcd/oled screen
<br>
**input:** mini keyboard + touchpad or custom keypad
<br>
**power:** rechargeable battery pack
<br>
**case:** custom 3d-printed or modified recycled enclosure
<br>
**extras:** usb hubs, gpio controls, wi-fi modules, led mods, and more


## timeline

### week zero : secure project funding
since this is a hardware based project, it would require some seed money that i was hoping to get via hackpac before rushil got banned but now that there's no one running it, it makes turning this project into a reality pretty hard due to financial constraints and limited resources. we could fundraise but hcb won't allow indians to make a club org even if they primarily plan on getting donations from the us only or spending the cards only at approved local vendors that accept american cards for payment.

### week one: introduction and planning
- overview of components – raspberry pi zero 2 w, displays, keyboards, power sources
- understanding linux mint – why we’re using it and its beginner-friendly environment
- sketching & planning your cyberdeck – choosing a layout, features, and personalization options
- sourcing parts – finding affordable off-the-shelf, 3d-printed, or salvaged components

<ins>homework:</ins> installing linux mint on personal device after creating a virtual machine 
<br>
### week two: core hardware assembly
- getting started with raspberry pi zero 2 w – setting up linux mint for arm
- connecting peripherals – mini displays, keyboards, usb hubs, and input devices
- 3d printing basics – understanding materials, slicing software, and getting your first print
- prototyping the build – assembling components in a temporary setup

<ins>homework:</ins> flash linux mint onto raspberry pi zero 2 w and install essential software.
<br>
### week three: display & interface setup
- connecting a screen – small lcd/oled displays for the pi zero 2 w
- configuring display settings – optimizing resolution and performance for a lightweight system
- setting up the keyboard & touchpad – usb, bluetooth, or gpio-based input
- basic linux commands – navigating the terminal, managing files, and installing software

### week four: power system & portability
- battery power vs. wall power – choosing a mobile power source for the pi zero 2 w
- building a rechargeable system – using a power bank or custom lithium-ion battery pack

### week five: cyberdeck enclosure & customization
- enclosure assembly – designing a case for the raspberry pi zero 2 w and accessories
- customizing with leds & personal touches – adding aesthetic & functional mods
- cable management & compact layouts – making everything fit neatly

### week six: software & personalization
- essential linux tools for cyberdecks – lightweight programs for raspberry pi
- offline & on-the-go tools – setting up a lightweight, self-contained system
  -  connecting to wi-fi & bluetooth – setting up internet access and pairing devices
  -  using ssh & remote access – controlling your cyberdeck from another computer
  -  basic file sharing – transferring files between your cyberdeck and other devices
  -  adding useful software – installing text editors, media players, and lightweight apps
- themes & ui customization – personalizing setup by changing wallpapers, terminal themes, and shortcuts
- security basics – hardening your cyberdeck (firewall, encryption, secure ssh)

### week seven: final touches
- debugging & final adjustments – troubleshooting, fixing issues, refining designs
- future expansion ideas – upgrading, adding new features, and continuous learning

### week eight: ✈️✈️✈️ SAN FRANSISCO !!!
