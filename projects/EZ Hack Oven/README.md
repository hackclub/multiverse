# EZ Hack Oven

**Created by:** [@Kaympe20](https://github.com/kaympe20) and [@Dandililacs](https://github.com/Dandililacs)

## 🌟 Elevator Pitch  
BakeBuild was a CAD YSWS that involved designing a cookie cutter, but wouldn't it be nice if you could cook your cookies with an oven you made.

## ⚙️ How It Works  
You will need to use:
* A CAD program like [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/) or [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360)
* An electrical circuit design program
* A 3D printing service if you don't have a printer.

## 🎮 How It Plays (for YSWS or Workshops)  
1. Each participant designs their own EZ bake oven in [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/) or [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360)
2. They then design the electrical circuits inside of the oven using [Wowki](https://wokwi.com/)
3. Their parts are printed out of ASA or Nylon
4. They build the oven
5. They keep the oven

## 🚀 The Development Plan  
I and [@Dandililacs](https://github.com/Dandililacs) will work together to make this happen. I will create a Jam and example project while [@Dandililacs](https://github.com/Dandililacs) will work on the logistics and marketing material.

## 🔥 What Challenges Do You Anticipate?  
I anticipate that fitting all parts on the build plate of a standard 3D printer will be challenging.

## 🎯 What Do You Hope to Learn?  
This will teach everyone involved both electrical circuitry and deepen their understanding of CAD.
