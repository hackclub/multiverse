## 🌟 Elevator Pitch  
The **YSWS** is an AI-powered smart plant pot designed to enhance plant care with a touch of personality! It features a built-in screen that displays emotions based on the plant’s needs—like happiness when it’s well-watered and sadness when it’s thirsty. If possible, game-like features can be integrated, making plant care more interactive and engaging.

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **PCB Design:** Use **EasyEDA** to design the printed circuit board (PCB).  
2. **Microcontroller:** Powered by **Seeed Studio XIAO**, a compact yet powerful microcontroller.  
3. **Programming:** Code the device using **C++** for logic and AI-driven interactions.  
4. **3D Modeling:** Use **Tinkercad** or other 3D modeling software to design and print the pot.  
5. **Assembly:** Put all the components together to bring the smart pot to life.

## 🎮 How It Plays (For YSWS or Workshops)  
1. **PCB Design:** Participants use **EasyEDA** to design the circuit board.  
2. **3D Printing:** Design and print the smart pot using 3D modeling software.  
3. **Programming:** Write and upload the C++ code for the plant pot's functionality.  
4. **Grant Request:** Submit a **pull request** to receive funding for PCB manufacturing and 3D printing.  
5. **Assembly & Testing:** Assemble the hardware components, test the system, and bring the smart pot to life!
