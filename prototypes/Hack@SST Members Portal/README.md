# Hack@SST Member Portal  

### Created by: Lai Hong Yu, Chiew Leung Yin  

## 🌟 Elevator Pitch  
A simpler and better alternative to Google Classroom! The **Hack@SST Member Portal** allows students to easily track attendance, view announcements, and access other essential features.  

## ⚙️ How It Works  
The portal is built using the following technologies:  
- **Firebase & Firebase Auth** → For secure authentication and real-time data storage  
- **NextJS** → For a fast, modern web application  
- **API Integration** → To ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Secure login with Firebase Authentication  
✅ View attendance records easily  
✅ Check announcements in real-time  
✅ User-friendly interface  
✅ Fast and lightweight design  

## 🎮 How Students Use It (For Workshops)  
1. **Log in** using school credentials.  
2. **Check attendance** records in a structured dashboard.  
3. **View announcements** from teachers or students.  
4. **Explore additional features** (coming soon! We hope to work on it in SF).  

## 🛠 Development Plan  
Our team is following a structured plan to ensure smooth development:  

1️⃣ **Backend Development**  
- Build a secure backend using Firebase.  
- Store attendance records, announcements, and user data.  

2️⃣ **Frontend & API Integration**  
- Connect the backend to a clean, modern frontend.  
- Ensure data is displayed efficiently.  

3️⃣ **UI/UX Improvements**  
- Enhance the design to be more user-friendly.  
- Optimize speed and accessibility.  

## 🔥 Challenges We Expect  
- **Slow loading times** for announcements and attendance tracking.  
- **Securing the API key** while ensuring authorized users can access the data.  
- **Managing user permissions** to prevent unauthorized changes.
